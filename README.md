# Cybernated Foosball #

Digital Foosball 2.0

---
The goal of this fork is to add raspberry pi support along with other features we want.

## Background ##

Head over to [Digital Foosball](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/digitalfoosball/) for background and instructions.

## Raspberry Pi?? ##

We *were* going to do Arduino, but someone in the office already had a Raspberry on hand, so here we are. All code for this will probably be python using REST to talk to the existing (and added) digitalfoosball/mobileapp node.js endpoints.

## Hardware ##

At the moment? Who knows. 

Breadboard + breakout: [Eleduino](http://www.amazon.com/Eleduino-Raspberry-Model-T-Cobbler-Breakout/dp/B00NKH9S7Q/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8)
Goal detection: [Geetech infrared sensors](http://www.amazon.com/Geeetech-Infrared-proximity-compatible-Arduino/dp/B00AMC1V2C)
Player detection: RFID (TBD)
Undo/Reset button: TBD
